## Smart-Load-shedding-Simulation

### Short Description
This project simulates intelligent zone-wise load shedding using MATLAB App Designer and Simulink. It dynamically monitors real-time demand and compares it against a predefined threshold to perform selective load shedding.

### ðŸ’¡ Features
- Zone selection and real-time monitoring
- Visual display of demand, threshold, and status
- Simulation results shown in a dynamic table and plot
- Responsive GUI using App Designer components (sliders, dropdowns, labels)

### Tools used
- Matlab
- App designer

#### 1. Full App Interface (Initial State)

#### 2. During Simulation (Active State)

#### 3. Zone-Specific Simulation
